## **Effective and Detailed Pull Request Guide**

A pull request is a mechanism in the software development process that allows developers to merge their code contributions. In this guide, we will provide tips and example scenarios for creating effective and detailed pull requests. We will also include sample CLI (Command Line Interface) code snippets to illustrate the steps.

1. **Creating a Branch:**

   - Before making changes to the main project source, create a new branch for your changes, such as `feat/user-authentication` or `bugfix/user-profile`.
   - Branch names should be descriptive and easy to understand.
2. **Planning the Changes:**

   - Create a plan for your changes and explain it in the pull request description.
   - Describe the purpose of your code, the reasons for your changes, and how you solved the problem.
3. **Code Quality:**

   - Ensure that your code adheres to the proper formatting and style guidelines (e.g., Dart standards).
   - Make sure your changes are compatible with the existing codebase.
4. **Merging (Rebase):**

   - Synchronize your pull request branch with the main branch (usually `main` or `master`) using `git rebase`.
   - This makes it easier for developers to understand and review your code.
5. **Comprehensive Testing:**

   - Write comprehensive tests to ensure that new features work as intended or that bugs are fixed.
   - Make sure all tests pass successfully and include the test cases with your pull request.
6. **Pull Request Description:**

   - Your pull request description should explain what you did, why you did it, and how you did it.
   - List the changes in a clear and descriptive manner so that reviewers can easily understand your contributions.
7. **Documentation:**

   - Update or add the necessary documentation for your changes to the project.
   - For large changes, consider creating a separate documentation file to make the changes more understandable.
8. **Code Review:**

   - Request code reviews from your team members or other developers.
   - Consider and implement feedback received during the code review process.
9. **CI/CD Integration:**

   - Ensure that your pull request passes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
   - This helps ensure that there are no issues, and all tests pass successfully.

### 1. Forking the Project <a name="forking-the-project"></a>

To contribute to a project on GitHub, you need to fork the repository first. Forking creates a copy of the original project under your GitHub account.

1. Go to the repository you want to contribute to.
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner.
3. The repository is now forked to your GitHub account.

### 2. Cloning the Project <a name="cloning-the-project"></a>

After forking the repository, you need to clone it to your local environment to make changes.

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Code" button and copy the HTTPS or SSH link.
3. Open your terminal (command line) and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project:

   ```
   cd /path/to/your/directory
   ```

4. Clone the project:

   ```
   git clone <copied-link>
   ```

### 3. Creating a Branch and Making Changes <a name="creating-a-branch-and-making-changes"></a>

Before making any changes, create a new branch to isolate your work.

1. Navigate to the cloned project directory:

   ```
   cd /path/to/cloned/project
   ```

2. Create a new branch and switch to it. The branch name should be descriptive of the changes you plan to make:

   ```
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

3. Make the desired changes to the project. These changes could be code edits, adding new features, or fixing bugs.

### 4. Committing and Pushing Changes <a name="committing-and-pushing-changes"></a>

After making changes, commit them to your branch.

1. Add the changes to the staging area:

   ```
   git add .
   ```

2. Commit the changes with a descriptive commit message:

   ```
   git commit -m "add✨ : new feature X"
   ```

3. Push the changes to your forked repository:

   ```
   git push origin my-feature
   ```

### 5. Creating the Pull Request <a name="creating-the-pull-request"></a>

Once your changes are pushed to the branch, it's time to create the pull request.

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Compare & pull request" button.
3. In the pull request creation page, write a descriptive title and a detailed description of your changes.
4. Review your changes and click "Create pull request" to submit it.

### 6. Pull Request Review and Merging <a name="pull-request-review-and-merging"></a>

Your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers and collaborators. Here are some tips for a smooth review process:

- Provide a clear and detailed description of the changes.
- Address any feedback or questions from reviewers promptly.
- Keep your pull request up-to-date with the main repository by rebasing if necessary.
- Be patient and open to constructive criticism.

Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main repository, and your contributions will become part of the project.

### 7. Additional Tips <a name="additional-tips"></a>

- **Keep Pull Requests Small:** Try to keep your pull requests focused on a specific task or feature. This makes reviewing and merging easier.
- **Write Meaningful Commit Messages:** Use descriptive commit messages that explain what changes were made. This helps other developers understand your work when looking at the project's history.
- **Reference Related Issues:** If your pull request addresses a specific issue or feature request, mention it in the description using GitHub's referencing system (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

### 8. Example Pull Request Scenarios <a name="example-pull-request-scenarios"></a>

**Scenario 1: Adding a New Feature**
Pull Request Title: "EP - Add Dark Mode Feature"
